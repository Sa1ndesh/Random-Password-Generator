🚀 QUICK START
===============

1. COMMAND-LINE VERSION (Beginner)
   - No installation required (uses built-in Python libraries)
   - Run: python main.py
   - Follow the prompts to generate passwords

2. GUI VERSION (Advanced)
   - Install dependencies: pip install pyperclip
   - Run: python gui_password_generator.py
   - Use the graphical interface for more options

📋 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows/macOS/Linux
- For GUI version: tkinter (usually included with Python)
- For clipboard functionality: pyperclip library

🔧 INSTALLATION STEPS
=====================

Step 1: Clone or Download
- Download all project files to a folder
- Ensure Python is installed on your system

Step 2: Install Dependencies (for GUI version)
- Open command prompt/terminal
- Navigate to project folder
- Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Application
- For command-line: python main.py
- For GUI version: python gui_password_generator.py

✨ FEATURES
===========

COMMAND-LINE VERSION:
- ✅ Custom password length
- ✅ Choose character types (letters, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Password strength indicator
- ✅ Generate multiple passwords in one session
- ✅ Input validation and error handling

GUI VERSION:
- ✅ All command-line features plus:
- ✅ User-friendly graphical interface
- ✅ Separate uppercase/lowercase options
- ✅ Advanced exclusion options (similar/ambiguous characters)
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality
- ✅ Color-coded strength indicator
- ✅ Clear and regenerate options

🛡️ PASSWORD STRENGTH GUIDE
============================
- Weak: < 8 characters or limited character types
- Moderate: 8-11 characters with 2+ character types
- Strong: 8-11 characters with 3+ types OR 12+ with 2+ types
- Very Strong: 12+ characters with all character types

🎯 USAGE EXAMPLES
=================

COMMAND-LINE:
$ python main.py
=== Random Password Generator ===
Enter password length: 12
Include letters? (y/n): y
Include numbers? (y/n): y
Include symbols? (y/n): y
✅ Generated Password: K9#mP2$vX8@q

GUI VERSION:
1. Launch: python gui_password_generator.py
2. Set desired length (4-128 characters)
3. Select character types
4. Choose advanced options if needed
5. Click "Generate Password"
6. Copy to clipboard or generate new one

🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

Problem: "pyperclip not found"
Solution: Run "pip install pyperclip"

Problem: "tkinter not found"
Solution: Reinstall Python with tkinter support or use command-line version

Problem: Weak passwords generated
Solution: Increase length and enable all character types

Problem: Can't copy to clipboard
Solution: Ensure pyperclip is installed and clipboard access is allowed

🚀 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
======================
- Password strength meter with visual indicators
- Save passwords to encrypted file
- Exclude specific characters option
- Password history (with security warnings)
- Web-based version using Flask
- Mobile app version
- Integration with password managers
- Bulk password generation
- Custom character sets
